Zend Studio, Aptana and Eclipse + PDT didn't meet my expectations, mainly due to user experience flaws (e.g. it was difficult for me to properly set up an SVN project) and later on, lack of support for recent technologies. Zend Studio was tightly integrated with Zend Framework, which I was using extensively at a certain point in my career, but I have moved on to other frameworks after ZF2 was released. NetBeans was a clear winner at a certain point in time, but it was late to introduce proper PHP 5.4 and 5.4 support, along with other flaws and bugs I sometimes encountered. I've been using PhpStorm for 3 years now and so far haven't found an IDE superior to it. Integration with NodeJS and Composer is exemplary, debugging with XDebug is easy and PHP 5.4/5.5 support was introduced almost immediately after both language versions went stable. UX is also very good and the availability of Angular.js support or the inbuilt Emmet plugin have grown to be features I cannot imagine working without.

I'm used to PhpStorm; it offers me a familiar user experience and covers absolutely all of the technologies I work with.

Eric Pantoja,26-32,Male,United States,Vocational school / community college,10,Sublime Text,"I have now been using Sublime Text for the past several months. I migrated to Sublime Text from Programmer’s Notepad which is a great, free, and a minimalistic IDE. With that being said, I really loved using Programmer’s Notepad, especially because of its broad support of many programming languages. I found myself developing more web applications and websites and needed something a bit more specifically focused on web technology. 

Sublime Text is a great mixture of simplicity and features. I was originally a self-taught developer and I can say that debugging is one of your biggest obstacles when you start out. I started programming on Windows notepad and am thankful for doing so. Having to many features when you start, in my opinion, can greatly affect your learning curve. If you are forced to face these problems head on, you gain a deeper understanding of the languages you develop in. 

Sublime Text offers the simplicity of simple text editors with great features that speed up development time. So far, I believe it is one of the best IDE’s because it has a nice balanced feel to continued learning, and progressive technology use.",TextMate,My choice was the same as the previous answer.

Missing one or the other of those features in a simple editor like notepad++ drove me to try out alternatives. Of what I have tried so far, phpstorm is my favorite. I learned to love its code formatting, the way it supports Phpdoc and its integration into frameworks, especially Symphony. And - on a more superficial level - I like how it looks and feels. But while it also supports me writing SCSI, editing Databases and debugging my code, I always came to a point where I felt locked into some kind of cage. For all off the pros mentioned before I have acquired specialized standalone solutions that do what they are supposed to do just as I want it to be over the years. Some of them I created myself, some I found after trying out lots of others. 
In the end, all that those IDEs where able to offer was delivering these features from one hand. While that could be a catch, I never liked the size and complexity of those IDEs. Not to mention the time they needed to start up. 
I prefer my development tools to be simple, quick and lightweight.

The third reason is the support for multiple developers. It has a simple check-in/check-out system. We would like to get into GIT but in our work environment, we are hardly given any time to research alternatives nor funding. We don't use DW's ""auto coding"". We build things from scratch using CodeIgniter as the framework. DW's ""auto coding"" is too bloated and it doesn't do everything we need. We mainly use it as a ""text editor on steroids"".

We have tried Notepad++ which is great but unfortunately it's only available in Windows. It also doesn't have an easy to use check-in/check-out system. We also tried TextMate, but it's only for Mac.

Axel Böswetter,26-32,Male,Germany,Master's Degree in CS / programming,11,PhpStorm,"I recently switched to PHPStorm coming from Netbeans. I've had heard already allot about it, but didn't start using it because of the missing feature to load projects from UNC paths. Netbeans is able to do that by default. But then I found a solution for the UNC path problem - and no, I wouldn't want to use network drives/ mounts. Instead I mounted the UNC paths as directory symlinks in Win7 and that is working like a charm. That trick enabled the use/ try of PHPStorm - and although Netbeans is a great IDE, PHPStorm definitely wins the competition. Code-Completion and project indexing is so much faster compared to Netbeans.
It also supports new language versions faster or supported other stuff like SASS/LESS earlier by default.
There is just one thing I miss in PHPStorm compared to Netbeans, the ability to show versioning information in the project tree. E.g. Netbeans shows the current tag name of svn:externals behind the folder in the project tree. This handy feature is still missing in PHPStorm...

I also used - even still use for smaller projects - WeBuilder/RapidPHP. It's a handy tool and I was an active forum member and involved in fotmer feature and bugfix releases. But compared to Netbeans or PHPStorm it's more or less an editor than a full fledged IDE. But I still like using it as mentioned.",PhpStorm,,

I had used it in other capacities before, and was quite proficient.  Working with vim was great since Netbeans is brutally slow.  At some point I decided to give emacs a try.  There is such a divide between vim and emacs; to be truly fair I knew I had to try both.  I quickly fell in love with emacs.  It is extensible, stable, and allows me to optimizes entire workflow instead of just my editing.  The deep integration with every language I have ever wanted to program in is also a huge boost.  And as far as I am concerned, no git interface even comes close to comparing to magit.  Emacs is an absolute joy for any editing task.

Windows, Linux and Mac loves NetBeans, so I’m able to work almost anywhere
2. Open source
If I'd need something exotic from NetBeans, I'd go to Java-developer and give him a task, which scenario is impossible in case of proprietary software.
3. Runs very stable
Every non-free PHP IDE I tried had various problems with stability, NetBeans runs almost rock stable, except of occasionally (no more than once in a working day) 1-5 sec freeze, like it’s doing something very important and don't wont to be interrapted.
4. An acceptable support for utf-8 and windows-1251
Those are two major encoding, I have to deal with. I'd add better support for non-UTF encodings, but what we have now is almost enough.
Of course I didn't try all IDEs (no time for them, time is money and when you see money don’t vast your time). As for now NetBeans works very good for me and my colleagues. It’s a little beat too much “open-sourced”, not as fast as some others, but it’s best for me.",NetBeans,,

I tried them all, IDEs and editors and as much as I wanted to switch to full featured IDE, I kept coming back to PSPad.

My killer argument: PHPStorm is clearly made by usability experts. Everything is logical, easy to find and reduces your workload dramatically. It adds functionalities to your work you never thought of. It replaces most of the fiddling on the command line with clever visual UIs.

But later my projects got bigger and bigger. Editing so many files in so many directories became harder.

So I switched to Netbeans and that was good decision till the moment I had to operate on code through samba connection. Netbeans couldn’t do that fast enough. So I finally switched to Sublime Text. My SSH/FTP connections are extremely fast and fully configurable (sending file automatically after saving to disc, downloading just specified folders, synchronizing files).

Except that PhpStorm helps me sync my files between my local storage and remote one. If I want to it's easy to sync it with GitHub.

It's also fast to jump between classes, functions, methods because PhpStorm scans your project's files.

I also would occasionally use VIM when when making quick edits on a server, but definitely would not be used in a large project of more than two or three files... I also have had some experience with Dream Weaver, but  found myself always wishing I was back in Eclipse because the auto complete was horrible. After thinking things could get no better, I started using Intellij by Jet Brains (instead of Eclipse) for my Java projects and was impressed at how much more efficient I was. The auto complete was to die for, the intellisense was instant and the debugger was amazing compared to Eclipse. So naturally I had to try PHP Storm as well.

During this period, I had to work with pre-existing code which was written with Dreamweaver, and dealing with varying line endings spoiled my interest in trying the Adobe tool (It may be an unjust prejudice, but that's how I felt about it and never considered trying it despite the allure of drag-and-drop HTML toolset.)

Then a colleague introduced my to  NetBrains and it basically blew my mind. This was also the point in my PHP career wherein auto-complete and parameter hinting was of great help, as it was when I got my hands dirty in CodeIgniter, my first ever exposure to PHP frameworks. I immediately dropped Notepad++ and its various plugins for NetBeans PHP IDE and its tightly-integrated plugins within a customizable workspace.

Then for a brief point I had to use a Mac for development, as I was required to code Objective-C with X-Code for some time. And when I was asked to work on a ZF1.11 PHP project, I had to look for a Mac-compatible PHP IDE as Netbeans declines to work on my Mac workstation, which brought me to experiment with Zend Studio 9. I found it frustratingly slow and ditched it shortly after. I settled with Sublime Text 2 which I found swift and appealing in the same way Notepad++ was. However, I still missed out on a lot of IDE features that I find essential day-by-day. Thankfully I was finally able to switch back to Windows and my Netbeans set-up.

Then time came when Zend Framework 2's first major release rolled about and I immediately dropped use of the now-legacy first version for the new release -- and it was also my introduction to PHP namespaces. And long story short, I found Netbeans' refactoring features as lacking, especially when dealing with namespaces (imports, renames, aliases, etc.)

Then I stumbled on PhpStorm, which was a life-changer. Netbeans fell out of my graces and the Jetbrains IDE took its place. It just simply works, and never sluggish. Everything I ever needed is easily available; source-control, smarter code formatting, even smarter auto-complete (especially when switching language contexts between PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Twig, etc. which NetBeans just cannot get right in a lot of situation), comprehensive per-project customization, and better readability and flexible customizations. And of course, the code-refactoring features that I was longing for. Notably, its namespace handling just trumps the other IDEs I have tried. And most of these are out-of-the-box! It may sound cliche, but the only IDE that could ever top PhpStorm 7 in the near future would be PhpStorm 8, and with the fact that Jetbrains have never disappointed me (...okay, maybe the absence of a cygwin integration in the IDE console), I'm looking forward to what new things it will offer.",PhpStorm,Same as above.,b_fb_2402

I started out with notepad++ and Vim. As the need for good project editor grew, so did the need for a good IDE.
I went along for eclipse, zend studio. Managed to try out aptana and Komodo (urgh).
But all these, where just minor thingies. 
Then one day I found out about PHPStorm, I dont remember when or how. All my collegues (most) where using Netbeans. 
I could not stop using PHPStorm, the amount of stuff it enables you to do, its just to much. Its like a pack of the very best, all neatly packaged in a single IDE.
Contrary to Netbeans, and all the other fuss, the IDE itself, was too easy to learn. And I still havent learned it all.
Integration with servers, included gitclient, seamless with xdebug, several profiles for code styles (very important!), several profiles for runtime enviroments, seamless integration with third party plugins. 
Other important aspect, is that I develop a lot with linux and windows, and having the same IDE for both (and hot keys) is important. 
By the time I left my previous company, barely anyone used NetBeans. 
Even the ""new kid"" on the block was not good enough, I mean you Sublime. Jack of all trades, master of none.
While I must use you to develop in Perl, it still hurts, but you are by far the best multi purpose IDE I have found.

Lets put some emphasis on Sublime, because I work with a very big perl application.

2. Its 'find usage' functionality, which enables me to see where I have used a particular function or variable elsewhere in the project, which can be crucial and time saving when working with a MVC project.

Then I've started using CodeCharge, a RAD IDE for PHP which did all the work for me by just pressing some few buttons. It wasn't a good way to achieve experience because I couldn't write the code the way I wanted, and I couldn't change the behavior without expect some 'you corrupted the code integrity' messages. All I could do was to follow it's structured API of functions and wish for the best. Then I've used CodeLobster with a free edition for almost a year, and it was great: finally I could learn by writing code the way I wanted to, and the IDE was light and faster. I could even debug (at that time I've never used XDebug before)! But it's autocomplete was too slow (it was in 2011), it had some troubles to create dockblocks correctly and there was the lack of users to discuss/share knowledge so that's when I've jumped to Eclipse using PDT. At a first sight everything was fine, but I must confess, I've never liked Eclipse (it's way to configure a particular php.ini file gave me headaches), so then I've started to jump to other IDEs like Aptana and Zend Studio (just by note, I'm a ZCE PHP 5.3 and I'd have a Zend Studio license which I've never used), and that's when I've noticed that I didn't like Eclipse at all. That's when I've started using NetBeans, on it's 7.2 version.

I use Sublime Text 2 because its performance is excellent once the index builds (which usually takes 1-2 minutes after opening a project). I like the quick file find abilities since I usually work with deep hierarchical file structures, and digging through folders is not convenient. Other IDEs offer the same features and many more, but the additional features come at the expense of snappy performace.

I used PHP Ed for about 4 years which I liked very much. In the job I had at the time I needed SFTP support built natively into the experience, and PHP Ed does this very well. Sublime Text does not support this, but in my current job I work with a Samba mount to our server, so I do not need that feature.

PHP Ed was excellent at almost everything other than global searching. The line by line debugger was excellent. It had a very good, intuitive code snippet feature which is very important to me.

As I moved deeper into Laravel, I also moved toward Sublime Text, which seemed to be growing up alongside the Laravel community in much the same way TextMate grew in popularity with the Ruby crowd. Its speed, and perhaps most importantly, its support for MULTIPLE CURSORS, are now vital to my work, and I find it hard to work without either.

Regardless, I keep flirting with PHPStorm -- which holds a lot of promise and an amazing focus on PHP-specific development, but so far its lack of speed and missing support for multiple cursors (a feature I admittedly never knew I needed until Sublime Text proved its usefulness) haven't QUITE convinced me to make the jump yet.",Sublime Text,Same as personal.,

Daniel,40+,Male,Australia,Mainly online courses like Udacity and Codeacademy,13,NetBeans,"Netbeans covers a good deal of features for PHP developers. The main feature I appreciate in working with Netbeans is the dynamic library auto-completion. This scans through the framework library in your project (or custom libraries) and includes class name and method hints from your library as you type. It's fast and also simple to open the relevant class file without any fuss. I have found this reduces the learning curve when working with a new framework.

I have used several IDE's including Eclipse, Zend Studio, Aptana and Dreamweaver, but settled on Netbeans due to its relatively simple setup, responsiveness and great auto-completion features. 

I also use text editors quite regularly and as a Mac user, I prefer TextWrangler. It has good features, a nice interface and it's free! I have also used TextWrangler's big brother BBEdit, but in most cases, found I was able to achieve the result I needed with TextWrangler.",Dreamweaver,"I use Dreamweaver at my workplace. Our team is a well established team using PC based development. Our servers and development environment are linux based and not local to our desktop computers. One of the good features with Dreamweaver is it's ability to automatically upload to a remote server on save. This transparently transfers edited files across to the remote or testing server without any need to manually intervene.

When PSPad stopped being actively developed, I started looking for a more modern IDE but it took at least 5 years of trying everything in sight before I finally found Komodo IDE. 

I tried Eclipse and NetBeans but found the java-based structure clunky, the performance horribly slow and the interface frankly ugly. Exclipse and it's PHP plug-ins never worked properly for me and I found it very frustrating (note: I have to work on a Windows OS which may have been part of the problem). 

I looked at many of the other IDEs (including many on the list in this article, such as PHPEdit, Vim, & Emacs, plus Zend Studio, Sublime & NuSphere PhpEd ) and editors (including EditPadPro, EditPlus2, TextPad ) but found most of them to be so similar in terms of features and user experience that there was no compelling need to move to them. 

I had a very specific list of requirements (including all the PSPad features listed above) born from the desire to move to a distinctly better IDE than the one I was leaving. Komodo IDE now has ALL these features and more. I also wanted a cross platform solution so that I could work in a familiar environment on Linux and Mac if necessary (all my servers run Linux, and I'm thinking about moving to the Mac OS in the future).  Komodo runs on top of  the Mozilla Framework and it's very fast and customisable. It's a pleasure to use.",Komodo IDE,"I'm a contractor and can choose my own tools.

Bas,26-32,Male,Netherlands,"Went to CS/programming College/University, didn't finish",15,NetBeans,"I prefer Netbeans for a number of reasons. 

One of these is the amazing freedom in configuring the IDE, for example the number of options available to you when using automatic code formatting, or the colours/theme of the application, or the location and size of all the available windows that you can use. 

Another important one (for me) is the integrated debugger. I use XDebug every day when programming in PHP and I like it. A lot. I cannot imagine programming without a debugger, it just makes debugging so much easier to do.

Then there is the integrated support for Git. No need to elaborate here.

Auto-completion of function names with their parameters, or variables, or constants for that matter, come to mind. Saves a lot of typing, and therefore prevents typo's.

And finally there is the integration of PHPdoc-generation. Simply start with /** before any class, function/method or variable/property, and Netbeans will generate everything it can for you. You just have to fill in the blanks. Anywhere in the code you can then just use Ctrl+Shift+Space and the editor will show you (or your team member) the documentation you wrote. Brilliant.

Sure, with a bit of effort to get over the learning curve I could probably get the same effect in another IDE, but why? It's a matter of effort vs reward, and there just isn't enough reward to make it worth the effort.

Besides, of all the IDEs I've tried (including Eclipse, Homesite way-back-when, and Notepad++) I find Dreamweaver the easiest on the eye. It's a very pretty piece of software. Maybe that sounds shallow, but if I'm going to stare at something for the greatest part of my working day then it really is a factor.",Dreamweaver,"I'm the only one of my kind at my workplace - the only web developer - and when I was first employed the position was newly created.

I have worked with Zend Studio, PHP Designer, Eclipse and Netbeans in the past,   if working on different OS wasn't a issue I would rather say phpDesigner would be my choise. It came with a full featured and no configuration needs debuger, which take me a considerable time to set up in Sublime by using the XDebug package. I would say Netbeans is the second choice when it comes down to only debuger.
For me the big win is being able to switch the coding language while keeping the small footprint, in eclipse and netbeans I would need to download a myriad of plugins weighting a dozen Mbs to be confortable running a 2 days project in python so this flexibility is also a big win for me.
From the usability standpoint have easy ways to split the screen, select columns across multiple lines navigate the code (talking about Sublime 3, not 2) is also a cool diferential. Not that this wasn't possible with other IDEs, but the default shortcuts didn't fit my personal taste and wasn't that easy to customize.
To finalize the vibrant community (IMHO a consequence of marketing and easier APIs) was also a big win; I could finally rest in peace assured that the next technology that would appear would be very quickly integrated in my IDE, examples being live reload, grunt etc. Importing themes and definitions from emacs also helps a quick support for almost any language/framework autocomplete features.",Sublime Text,"Basically because I can choose and because it works in any OS, at work I need to use windows in some situations, while at home I use Linux and MacOS.",zga8oaw1n3

The key reason that I use PhpStorm over all the others is that it has so much functionality which helps reduce the time required for development. 

Specifically, it helps me step back to a previous point where I was working, or forward, the syntax highlighting is fantastic, whether it's PHP errors, non-used objects, used files, or even grammar mistakes (though this is less important). 

It's ability to quickly navigate through a codebase, whether by searching, function name, class name and more is brilliant. 

There are so many features, but the last one I'll mention is the code refactor. I'm prone to mistakes, but having the ability to refactor function names, class names, function signatures on the fly really has helped me out no end.

On the less important level, the ability to customise the interface, whether colours, or fonts or the whole UI is superb. The guided flexibility is really helpful.",PhpStorm,,

NuSphere's PhpED is also great with it's integrated debugger and profiler, but a little bit overpriced for me. Notepad++ also great, because it's free and speedy, but available only on Windows. PHPEdit has ugly interface. Java based editors like Eclipse, Zend Studio, Netbeans and PhpStorm are foreign look and sluggish.  RapidPHP lacks some of the previosly mentioned features.

Komodo edit has syntax checker which helps with small errors like missing semicolons, mismatched quotes etc.

Komodo edit also has dropdowns for PHP functions, missing in editors like textmate or sublime (extensions needed).

Only thing komodo edit is missing is when you are OO programming instead of scripting. Class property/function dropdowns (like eclipse/aptana) are helpful.

Never felt need of editor to auto commit/auto upload stuff. Filezilla/Transmit, Versions/Tortoise are better at it.

Also, never felt the need to run project/view output in IDE, cause browser/CLI are better at it. Also that makes IDE heavy, slowing you computer.",Komodo Edit,,

After having to switch to eclipse for my current job position, I realized this even more. Examples are:
While Netbeans gives me Task-Tags (// TODO, etc.) without having to do anything, I still haven't figured out how to make them work in Eclipse, especially across various different project types (Java, PHP, etc.) and with custom tags (// HINT, // ANNOTATION, // SUGGESTION, etc.)

There are various more examples like controlling file encoding, collapsing regions, code completion and intellisense which all worked perfectly out of the box in Netbeans, yet required me to do a good load of adjustments and configurations in eclipse.

A definite downside of Netbeans, compared to eclipse, is the addons and modules that are available for eclipse. The community and the addon repository is just so much bigger and, due to it's flexible nature, eclipse is just available for more project types than Netbeans.",Eclipse with PDT,"The standard IDE at the office is eclipse.

Finding a ressource editor that is compatible to the syntax we're using in our ressource files for internationalization. Integrating the IDE with the (not fully up2date) version of mercurial being used for versioning.

PHPStorm's navigation tools for these standard languages was nice, but expected of a PHP IDE. When PHPStorm really shined, however, was when we moved to a language that was not a ""standard"" language.

We moved to using mostly JavaScript with making PHP the API layer to the database. With this move we also started using Node.js, Grunt, Handlebars, and finally TypeScript. I was fully expecting PHPStorm's usefulness to now amount to near zero.

I was shocked, however, when I discovered that PHPStorm had native support for TypeScript, a high-quality handlebars plugin, and even an amazing Jasmine and Karma testing environment plugin. All the tools we use in PHPStorm for our developement are completely invaluable and I couldn't live without them.

PHPStorm is a surprisingly powerful IDE that seems, to me, to be the only code editing software a web developer could ever need. The only thing I miss is the mutli-cursor feature of sublime text. Once PHPStorm has that, I'll never look back.",PhpStorm,,

If you can afford it or your company will purchase it for you then get it. First, I love th customization you can do with the IDE. There are multiple preset layouts or you can create your own custom layout. There are multiple color themes, and multiple Plugins for specific language syntax code completion. The next big thing is the web server integration. You can setup your webs servers and edit your code directly of you can download a copy to your local and edit code there and then push it up to your web server. Third, is the company behind DreamWeaver, Adobe. Adobe is not going anywhere and you will always have support. Plus DreamWeaver is widely used so their is a ton of articles out there on using DW plus many books covering DW. Now if you are strickly a backend developer then using DreamWeaver might be a bit overkill due to the high price tag, but it can still handle some backend code.",Notepad++,"Because we have multiple servers in the cloud, we have NotePad++ installed on each server for some quick edits.

I do not need to publish application directly to the server so all the compiling, running, publishing stuff from Aptana slow downed me.
Sublime text is text editor firstly, that lets you focus on the code. Minimalist interface does not distract you. Opening files with the keyboard is awesome. In the beginning I did'n realize, that moving the mouse to traverse through the files repository takes so long. Having in mind the files tree gives me more focus on the architecture of the developed application and better knowing where to put the code. I wont start talking about managing additional packages.

The reason that this relationship didn't work out is that I began developing primarily in Ubuntu. Komodo seems to have a significant memory leak pertaining to scanning project directories that was difficult to resolve. So, I was left with the option of either using no code completion, or trying something different. I read an article about time saving techniques with PHPStorm on Sitepoint, and decided to give it a whirl. I was pretty was blown away immediately. It had version control that actually worked! It allowed you to easily jump around from one edited area to the next! It remembered multiple items on the clipboard! It refactored and formatted my code for me! Sure, the refactoring/formatting isn't always perfect, but it provides a starting point from which I can put in the details. All in all, PHPStorm does so much, I can't even mention it all (mess detector is another cool one).

This, of course, has caused me to look for an editor that supports multiple features and languages for my go-to IDE at home. I have tried Nodepad++ and Eclipse and Netbeans, but the latter two are bulky and occupy a lot of resources for projects that don't really require that much (I'm a fan of deploying everything from the command-line) and the former reminds me too much of Notepad and the horrors of highschool HTML projects. I started using Sublime after reading an article about it and having a friend rave about how awesome it is. And he was right. It's exactly what I need for my multi-language projects. And coding in PHP, as a natural consequence, became that much better.",PhpStorm,"I have, of course, started my journey into PHP with Netbeans, which was the recommended IDE for interns. While it was doing exactly what I needed, PHP wise, once we started working with frameworks, Drupal in particular, Netbeans started requiring a lot of extra configuration and didn't help much with framework-specific functions and classes. And then I discovered PhpStorm and its Drupal integration. After that coding suddenly became that much easier and fluid. There were also the nifty schemes (I particularly like the Darcula one) and the ability to customize everything about your coding process.",

The first thing I try on a IDE is how fast it is. I don't care about how much RAM it uses as I got plenty to spare. By how fast I mean load time, close time, and how responsive menus feel. If I tap a key command and the next window or action lags and I have to wait until the next one opens then points go down. It's not that I'm impatient but as a developer I use thousands of shortcuts every day and a few millisecond lag becomes very annoying.
The second thing I test is autocomplete. The smarter the autocomplete, the better. If the IDe ""speaks"" my framework of choice (ZF2) without any plugins even better. A lousy autocomplete is a deal breaker for me.
Third comes key commands customizations. While I don't need much in this particular point, it's a necessary evil. If the IDE can handle the 4 or 5 things I need, that's OK. 

What I like about PhpStorm is that it is the fastest IDE I've ever worked with. Searching is almost instantaneous even with funky patterns. I love the ""search in comments"" and in ""string literals"". This kind of fine grained search has been extremely helpful in many cases. Also, the Navigate to File (command + shift + O) is AMAZING. The fact that you can time ""IC"" and it would understand that you want to go to ""IndexControlle.php"" is one of the features that I use the most. I probably use this feature once every 10 seconds.
I also like that I can open and close new projects instantaneously. One window per project, easy as that. I usually get questions from the developers that I manage and this questions may be from any of the projects that we are working on, so being able to open a project on the spot is a big plus. Switching project on other IDEs I tried has not been as snappy as with PhpStorm. Another thing I love is PhpStorm's auto-formatting rules. They put a rule for almost every possible case and formatted code 90% of times looks exactly like I want. Another one I like is the ""Annotate"" feature that shows you a git blame for every line on the file. This instantly lets you know who wrote what on a file.
Finally, I've asked for a feature request which ended up being included in a future version so it's good to know they listen to their users.

I use TextWrangler (free version) for stuff that doesn't require syntax highlighting. The feature I use the most is the files list. It keeps all the stuff you opened before in a list for quick access (unlike a menu which is slow). TextWrangler's load time is almost zero! One feature I use often is Textwrangler's regular expression search and replace but that's about it.",PhpStorm,,zend

NetBeans was very powerful and had good SVN support. Support for Xdebug was fantastic. PHPStorm was beautiful, fast, and had an excellent plugin base. I would prefer it over NetBeans except that it isn't free.

The reason I chose SublimeText (even though it isn't free), is simple: unmatched awesomeness. I never understood the advantages of keeping an editor simple until I used Sublime. It is lightning fast, the only IDE I can use to edit project files over a VPN without serious lag. The plugin community is superb. Best of all is the workflow. It can be completely keyboard-driven, even opening files (albeit with the help of a plugin). And a key feature that I can't live without after having it: multiple cursors.

I used Zend Studio at the beginning but then they changed to Eclipse and lost one of the most important advantages of the IDE - simplicity and ease of use.

To Use: ctrl + r
When you have a large file with a bunch of methods, pressing ctrl + r will list them all and make them easier to find. Just start typing the one you want and press enter.

File Switching
To Use: ctrl + p
Sublime Text provides a really fast way to open up new files. Just press ctrl + p and start typing the name of the file you want. Once it shows up, just press enter and start typing directly into that file!

Command Palette
To Use: ctrl + shift + p
The command palette let’s you access pretty much anything in the settings menus, call your package commands, change file syntax, handle Sublime projects, and so much more.

For instance, you are able to call Git commands add, branch, commit, push, and pull all from the command palette.

Multi-Edit
To Use: ctrl+click
But there are many different ways to use multi-edit:
ctrl + d: Select the current word and the next same word
ctrl + click: Every place you click will create a cursor to edit
ctrl + shift + f AND alt + enter: Find a word in your files and then select them all

Projects
To Use: ctrl + alt + p
Projects is an integral part of my workflow in Sublime Text. A project is just a Sublime workspace in which your folders are open and stored in the sidebar. This helps since you can define a project and add folders to it, and be able to switch between folders quickly.

I use it spanned across two monitors and it often remembers the exact position of the window even after reboots. I'm using the Nimbus look and feel and love the shape and placement of the scroll bars. There seems to be a lot of error/warning checking going on and it is quite seamless. Opening multiple files and splitting/grouping them up on my screen is very functional and easy. 

At one point I moved my project onto a web server that I had ssh access to, so I started using vim to clean up my work. I noticed that Netbeans had been using spaces that didn't work well with tabs in vim, so I used vim convert everything over. I then found the options in Netbeans to change my tabs to tabs (not spaces) of my desired length (same as vim). I liked the power and efficiency of command line editing with vim, but I don't have much desire to run it in cygwin, and I like the UI organization that Netbeans provides.

I tried Zend Studio around the same time, and again, the JRE-based editors were just miserably slow (although part of that was due to the nightmare of a legacy PHP 4.x codebase on which I was working at the time). One IDE I found quite intriguing was JCX Software's VS.Php plugin for Visual Studio 2005/2008, since it didn't have a tendency to bog itself down every time I tried to open a file.  Since then, I've become accustomed to NetBeans due to the amount of Java programming I did for college.  Freeware, more responsive than Zend or Eclipse, and... Well, let's just say I miss the UML editor plugin from back in v6.7, and that's still a bit of a sore spot.

I tried Netbeans before and I find it slow and I don't really like how every time I type there is an Intellisense popping up. 

I heard sublime two years ago and fell in love with it quickly. It was a natural transition from N++. Sublime let's you edit all shortcuts and gives you an easy way to install plugins. I also remapped all my N++ shorcuts to Sublime which made the transition faster.

Editing using Multiple Cursor was a time saver. Fuzzy Search on Command Pallete almost eliminates mouse usage.

CodeCompletion on Sublime works like a charm they don't give you suggestions on what methods are available but you get the variable name or the classname which is sufficient for me.

I want to become a better programmer so I decided to start using a Sublime. Some features designed to make you more productive can also make you lazy and oblivious. Code suggestions and insertion of use clauses are the main culprits for me. I want to be in control of every line of code and want to understand objects and methods I am using in depth. The IDE somehow robs you of this. In a text editor it is different. Although there is some amount of code suggestion available on Sublime I do not consider if harmful at the moment.

Additionally, there are plenty of vendor- and community provided plugins that assist with using PHP frameworks, connecting to DB, deploying to FTP servers, integrating with your bugtracking systems, you name it, you got it.

What I am really missing in PHPStorm is the Tasktop tool I was heavily using with eclipse -  I loved to have all related mails and stuff bound to a task, so if I open a task I got every information available or needed.

Syncing with git and remote server is excellent.
